-# **Agentic Checklist**
-
-If you are prototyping an Agentic AI implementation, you need another step. Agentic AI prototypes are complex enough to warrant a separate checklist. However before going into such a checklist, it is important to verify the sanity of even contemplating an Agentic AI project. Therefore, please answer the following questions:
-
-- [ ] Are the processes the Agentic AI implementation will be contributing to known?  
-- [ ] Have the processes been reviewed for relevance?
-
-As the processes are split into steps to be performed by humans, you may find that it is harder for Agentic AI to implement an individual step than a larger part of the project. Doing more work to deliver an unconvincing result is the very opposite of a well-defined prototype.

-If you reviewed the processes, and believe you have viable scope, please complete separate Agentic AI Prototype Checklist available at
